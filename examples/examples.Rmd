```{r}
advert = read.csv("Advertising.csv")

#fix(advert)
names(advert)

plot(advert$TV, advert$sales)
myresult = lm(sales~TV, advert)
abline(myresult, col = "red")

summary(myresult)
```

So, with our linear model and our $\beta_0, \beta_1$, we can interpret this data as for each $1000 we spend on radio, we have an increase of about 203 units of sale.

```{r}
confint(myresult) 
```
With this, we can say that we have a 95% confidence that the intercept is between these two values, same with the radio slope. An interval estimate with a level of confidence is more useful than a pt estimate.
