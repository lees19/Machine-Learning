    \item Applied Math, 2022
    \item Yes.
    \item In five years, I hope to be in some industry job doing some kind of data 
    science or finishing grad school.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Defense, Shooting and Dribbling are all predictors and the response is 
        whether or not they were drafted. 
        \item To find distance: $\sqrt{(x_{1} - \hat{x}_{1})^2 +(x_{2} - \hat{x}_{2})^2 + (x_{3} - \hat{x}_{3})^2} $
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $1$
            \item $\sqrt{2}$
            \item $3$
            \item $\sqrt{6}$
            \item $\sqrt{2}$
            \item $\sqrt{18}$
            \item $\sqrt{5}$
        \end{enumerate}
        \item When $K = 1$, Player 1 is closest, and was not drafted, thus we classify
        our new player as being not drafted
        \item When $K = 3$, Players 1, 2, 5 are closest and the majority are drafted, 
        thus our new player is classified as drafted.
        \item When $K = 5$, Players 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 are closest and the majority are drafted, 
        thus our new player is classified as drafted.
    \end{enumerate}
